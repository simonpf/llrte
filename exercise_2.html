<h1>Exercise 2<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>For the second exercise, a domain was considered that would not only
absorb radiation, but also scatter it in forward or backward direction.
Again, the exercise consisted of two parts. In the first one a homogeneous
domain was to be simulated and in the second on a heterogeneous domain.</p>
<p>Similar as for the first exercise, the simulations can be run by building the <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exercise_2</span></code>
target using <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make</span></code>:</p>

<h2>Part 1<a class="headerlink" href="#part-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first part of the exercise consisted of the simulation of a homogeneous
medium with the following properties</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Optical-depth: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span> = 1</li>
<li>Single scattering albedo: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span> = 0.8</li>
<li>Forward-to-backscattering ratio <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(VR = 0.8\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>For a homogeneous slab of an extent of 10 km, this translates to an
absorption coefficient <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_a = 0.2 \cdot 10^{-4}\ \text{m}^{-1}\)</span> and
scattering coefficient <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_s = 0.8 \cdot 10^{-4}\ \text{m}^{-1}\)</span>.</p>

<h3>Varying grid resolution<a class="headerlink" href="#varying-grid-resolution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The results for varying grid sizes are displayed in the figure below. Compared
to the first exercise, the high single-scattering albedo and forward-to-backscattering
ratio effectively reduces amount of radiation the is absorbed by the domain.</p>
<p>A quite drastic effect of the grid resolution on the amount of scattered intensity
is visible in the results. This is not surprising since the number of samples per
grid cell decreases as the number of grid cells decreases. For the absorption, however,
this effect is not observed since photons continuously deposit energy along their path
thus increasing the number of samples per bin.</p>

<h3>Varying photon counts<a class="headerlink" href="#varying-photon-counts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For variations in the number of simulated photons an effect on both the absorbed intensity
as well as the scattered intensity is observed. As expected, for low photon counts, the results
become more noisy.</p>

<div class="section" id="varying-optical-depth">
<h3>Varying optical depth<a class="headerlink" href="#varying-optical-depth" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Quite naturally, the results become more interesting as the optical properties of the medium
are varied. The figure below shows the how the radiative transfer through the medium is
modified as its optical depth is varied. These results were obtained with 100 grid cells and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^4\)</span> sampled photons. Quite intuitively, the absorption as well as the scattering
increases as the optical depth of the medium is increased.</p>

<h3>Varying forward-to-backscattering ratio<a class="headerlink" href="#varying-forward-to-backscattering-ratio" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The next figure displays the effect of varying the forward-to-backscattering
ratio between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.2\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.8\)</span>. The effect of this is most clearly
visible in absorption curves show in panel (a). A decreased value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(VR\)</span>
leads to increased absorption closer to the source and decreased absorption
further away from the source. For high values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(VR\)</span> the effect is the
opposite. Overall a lower forward-to-backscattering ratio increases the amount
of radiation absorbed by the medium. This is a fairly intuitive result since
backscattering event increase the path length of photons traveling through the
medium.</p>

<div class="section" id="varying-single-scattering-albedo">
<h3>Varying single-scattering albedo<a class="headerlink" href="#varying-single-scattering-albedo" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Finally, the effect of varying the single-scattering albedo is investigated. The results
are displayed in the figure below. A lowered single-scattering albedo increases the absorption
in the medium, while an increased single-scattering albedo decreases it. Also this result
is quite intuitive since the lower single scattering albedo corresponds to an increased
absorption cross section and considering the high foward-to-backscattering ratio of the medium.</p>

<h2>Part 2<a class="headerlink" href="#part-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We briefly show results for a heterogeneous medium. The simulation uses the same
geometry as above with an optical depth <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau = 1\)</span>. The heterogeneity is
introduced at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x = 5\)</span> km, where the single scattering changes from
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(VR = 0.8\)</span> to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(VR = 0.2\)</span>. The results are shown in the figure below.
The effect of the increased absorption caused by the jump in forward to
back-scattering ratio is clearly visible in the results. In particular, the
non-local effect of the scattering properties of the medium become apparent,
since the absorption is increased even in the first half of the domain.
Regarding the frequency of scattering events, it is noticeable that the number
of zero scattering event is unchanged by the heterogeneity, which is expected as
the scattering cross section of the material is unchanged.</p>
