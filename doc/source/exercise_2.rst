Exercise 2
----------

For exercise two, bi-directional scattering was added to the RT simulation.


First part
==========

The first part of the exercise consisted of the simulation of a homogeneous
medium with the following properties

- Optical-depth: $\tau$ = 1
- Single scattering albedo: $a$ = 0.8
- Forward-to-backscattering ratio = 0.8

For a homogeneous slab of an extent of 10 km, this translates to an
absorption coefficient :math:`\sigma_a = 0.2 * 10^{-4}\ \text{m}^{-1}` and
scattering coefficient :math:`\sigma_s = 0.8 * 10^{-4}\ \text{m}^{-1}`.
